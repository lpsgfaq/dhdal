General FAQ - LAN Party Setup Guide and General Information (Dreamhack Dallas) by Michael OHara

Step 1 - WTF is Dreamhack?

Dreamhack is a gaming festival that has annual events worldwide, including in Dallas, TX at the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center. It is normally run from May 31st to June 2nd every year.

Step 2 - What is there to do at Dreamhack?

If it's a game, whether it be Tabletop, Arcade, or in the BYOC; there's a good chance someone is playing it. There are also eSports competitions that run during the event, not limited to the Counter Strike 2 tournament as part of Intel Extreme Masters, but also events for Overwatch, Starcraft 2; and various other games. For a full listing, please check out the Dreamhack website @ https://www.dreamhack.com/dallas/

Step 3 - How are events at Dreamhack announced?

The parent company that runs Dreamhack will typically post event info on Social Media first, then their Discord.

Step 4 - How do I get tickets?

You can visit the DH website at https://www.dreamhack.com/dallas and select the Badges option at the top right hand corner of the page. (Note: As of 04/05/2024 - All BYOC badges are sold out). Dreamhack's parent company uses Tixr for badge purchase, as well as any addons that are purchased. 

Step 5 - I have my tickets, how do I get in?

Simple! You'll need to either have the Dreamhack app (available on both Apple App Store/Google Play) or the event website open on your mobile device to have the QR codes scanned that are linked to your account, which will grant your purchased badges. The event website is https://www.dreamhack.com/app/DHDAL24/

You will also have to have a bag check performed by venue security in order to gain access to the event.

Step 6 - I have BYOC tickets, where do I need to go?

You will need to first have your PC or Console (we don't judge here) bag or case checked by venue security before you are able to get your BYOC badges. They will also check any secondary bags and your person for any contraband. Please use common sense when packing your items, as event staff will be backed up by on-site and plain clothes officers with the Dallas Police Department and the Dallas County Sheriff's Office the entirety of the event.

Step 7 - How do I find my BYOC seat and get setup?

Each row will be lettered in order from A-Z, and AA-ZZ. Find your designated row, and your seat number; and plug in your stuff! You should have access to both power and Ethernet. It is of note that General BYOC attendees are given access to symmetrical 100mb internet, with Premium and Ultra attendees having access to symmetrical gigabit internet.

Step 8 - Why is Gandalf Nodding?

Gandalf nodding is the unofficial mascot of the Dreamhack BYOC. Best to acknowledge it and move on. He will be nodding all weekend, until the event is over on Sunday.

Step 9 - Updating/Downloading Games (and why you should do it pre-event)

It's best practice to check your installed games prior to traveling for any updates. While some games have released updates in the past during the event, having everything up to date allows you to spend more time gaming versus waiting on your download to complete *then* jumping in to game.

Step 10 - WTF I broke my shit and I need to replace it!!!

If it worked before you left for Dreamhack, there's a chance it'll stop working during the event. Or you spiked something too hard on the convention floor, and it shattered. 

You have a couple of options to get replacement things. For display cords and PC-related peripherals and components, Micro Center is about 20-25 minutes away with no traffic off of US-75 and Spring Valley Rd. From the convention center, follow the signs to merge onto Northbound US-75. Follow the road about 20-25 minutes, and exit Spring Valley Rd. Once you have exited, you will need to U-Turn and move to the far right lane. You literally can't miss Micro Center, there's a giant sign outside!

For console peripherals, you have a couple of choices. There are both a Best Buy and a Gamestop within driving distance of the venue. Best Buy is approximately 15 minutes away with no traffic. Follow the signs to merge onto Northbound US-75, and exit to exit 5B and take the frontage road. For Gamestop, follow the same route for Best Buy; but take exit 4B. Turn right onto Caruth Haven Rd, then take the next right onto Greenville Avenue, and Gamestop will be on the right hand side; next door to a Whataburger location.

Step 11 - Why no F******e

While the game will be playable at the event in the BYOC, there are no event-run tournaments per the parent company of Dreamhack. If you have to ask why or want to consider begging for one, take a look in the mirror (and how you carry yourself in general) before you speak.
